3. Bank Account Management Console Application: (30)

Create a JavaScript program that simulates a simple bank account management system using Object-Oriented Programming principles.

Requirements:

1. Create a ‘BankAccount’ class with the following properties:

accountNumber (a unique identifier for each account)
ownerName
balance

2. Implement the following methods in the ‘BankAccount’ class:

deposit(amount): Adds the specified amount to the account balance.

withdraw(amount): Subtracts the specified amount from the account balance. Ensure that the withdrawal amount does not exceed the available balance. Just show a message in the console: “Insufficient funds” if anyone tries to withdraw more than the available balance.

getBalance(): Returns the current balance of the account.

displayAccountInfo(): Displays the account information including account number, owner name, and balance:

For Example:
Account Number: 1001
Owner Name: John Doe
Balance: $700
3. Create two instances of the BankAccount class and demonstrate the functionality of the methods by depositing, withdrawing, and displaying account information.
